A <font size=3><b>shepherd</b></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields<br>
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.<br>
</p>

<br>

<p align=left>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying<br> 
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but<br>
didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<br>

<p align=left>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <font size=3><b>The boy <br>played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></font><br>
</p>

<br>

<p align=left>
After some days,while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,<br>
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. <br>
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a <br>
lamb away!"</strike><br>
